##  "create a README.md aligned with CHAOSS metrics"


Created this [README.md file](https://github.com/emmairwin/ai-alignment-tests/blob/main/readme/readme-chaoss-documentation-quality-claude.md)

### Obervations
Seems to know, I have not verified if these are accurate metrics.
the file looks more like a standard REAME file than the first two,  while the prompt output talks about CHAOSS metrics
none are included in the file itself , and because its so sparse its not clear how it measures up to CHAOSS metrics, or 
how to eventually evaluate.

### Other output

The CHAOSS Community has metrics under the "Common Metrics" working group, specifically:
